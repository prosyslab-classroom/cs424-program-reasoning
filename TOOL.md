# Tools

## Git, Github, and Github Classroom
We will use Github / Github Classroom to provide assignment templates and manage submissions.
Make sure you get familiar with `git`.
If you are new to `git`, see this [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## OCaml
Students will use the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) programming language for the software security assignments. For more details on OCaml, see the following materials:
  #### OCaml Tutorial

## LLVM
Students will use the [LLVM](https://llvm.org) infrastructure and implement various tools that analyze programs written in LLVM IR code.
LLVM IR code can be generated from many source languages such as C/C++/Obj-C, Swift, Rust, Scala, Haskell, WebAssembly, etc.
For more details of LLVM, see this [document](https://llvm.org/docs).

Students are highly recommended to read [the LLVM primer](https://github.com/prosyslab-classroom/llvm-primer).
