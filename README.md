## Course Description
The main theme of this course is __"the relationship between specification and program"__ for safe and reliable software.
This course will cover two topics under the theme:
1. **program verification**: how to automatically _prove_ whether a given program satisfies the specification,
2. **program synthesis**: how to automatically _generate_ a program that satisfies the specification.

Students will learn theories and practices of program verification and synthesis through lectures, assignments, and term projects.

## Grading
- Homework: 50%
- Final Exam: 40%
- Participation: 10%

## Textbook
- Lecture slides will be provided
- [Program Synthesis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/program_synthesis_now.pdf) (PS)
- [Introduction to Program Synthesis](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/SynthesisCourse/index.htm) (IPS)
- [The Calculus of Computation](https://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Computation-Procedures-Applications-Verification/dp/3540741127) (COC)

## Homework
This course includes programming assignments through which students will learn how to design
and implement program synthesizer and program verifier.
Students will use a few tools which are described [here](TOOL.md).

All submissions will be managed using Github.
For each assignment, a unique invitation URL for Github Classroom will be posted in the [issue board](../../issues).
Once you accept the invitation, a private repository for your assignment will be created.
You can push as many commits as you want before the deadline. We will grade the final commit of your `master` branch.

The late homework policy is as follows:
- 80% credit for one day late
- 50% credit for two days late
- NO credit given after two days late

## Academic Integrity Violation
Students who violate academic integrity will get F.
See [the KAIST CS honor code](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSn63tEvq6R0G6n3Cz7jKX16RWvDy2giBKm8EVJtQHUBJoDA/viewform).
